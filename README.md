#Winter 2021 Personal Project

##About 
This is something written during the 2021 winter break to better my coding skills and do something nice.

##Ideas
1. Program that rates the "interesting-ness" of soccer games
2. Timetabling program
3. Board game creator game engine (like settlers of Catan but flexible)



##Implementation: Idea #1
###Interesting-ness rating:
1. Goals scored - more # of goals
2. Goal differential - low differential4
3. Shots/Shots on target - more # of shots
4. Similar number of shots - low differential
5. Similar number of shots on target - low differential
6. Similar possession - low differential 
###How to evaluate
1. Past games
2. Similar spot on the table 
3. Rivalry/Derby 
4. Similar recent form (past X matches) - teams in similar situation
5. Number of red/yellow cards - take into account if both teams are getting cards, possible a heated game 
6. Star players* possibly use FIFA rating?

###Matches Considered
Top 5 Euro leagues (for now)
###Format
The program would output all ratings for games on the next matchday.
The games would then be given an interesting rating from 0.0 to 10.0.
